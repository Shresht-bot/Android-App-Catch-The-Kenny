Catch the Kenny game is based on an arcade game called Whac-A-Mole. 
In our game, kenny runs in a 3x3 grid (appearing and disappearing) and the player has to catch it (tap on the kenny wherever it appears). 
Itâ€™s a simple and fun game which people of all age groups can play.
The player has to catch the kenny the maximum times he/she can in a limited time period. 
Each correct catch increases the score by 1 point. 
The player can choose the difficulty level of the game, meaning how fast the kenny would appear and disappear.
